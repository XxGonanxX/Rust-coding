To compile and run de Rust programs, I will be
using Cargo, all I need to remember for now is

CARGO NEW (NAME OF THE FOLDER)

This command creates a new folder for projects
with all the needed stuff.

CARGO RUN

This command will compile and create de executable
for my program, it will also execute on terminal

CARGO CHECK

This command will tell me if my code can compile,
but it won't create the executable cuz it takes
more time.

CARGO BUILD --RELEASE

This command will compile a program ready for user 
to use and all that stuff, it's supposed that it
won't be changed.




To use external dependencies, you need to add them in
the Cargo.toml file. Once you run the cargo build command,
it will download the dependencies you wanted, and it will 
also download the dependencies of the dependencies you
wanted, and so on.
